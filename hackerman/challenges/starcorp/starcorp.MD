Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print “StarCorp”. For multiples of 5 print "IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print “StarCorpianos”.

But here's the catch: you can use only one if. No multiple branches, ternary operators or else.

- Requirements

    * 1 if
    * You can't use else, else if or ternary
    * Unit tests
